                an island that also contains a lake within the Main Crater. Eruptive activity during 1-9 July 2021 was 
                
                characterized by phreatomagmatic explosions, gas-and-steam emissions, including sulfur dioxide emissions,

                building-construction history. When the French government was organizing the International Exposition 
                of 1889 to celebrate the centenary of the French Revolution, a competition was held for designs for a 
                suitable monument. 
                
                More than 100 plans were submitted, and the Centennial Committee accepted that of 
                the noted bridge engineer Gustave Eiffel. Eiffelâ€™s concept of a 300-metre (984-foot) tower built almost 
                entirely of open-lattice wrought iron aroused amazement, skepticism, and no little opposition on aesthetic 
                grounds. When completed, the tower served as the entrance gateway to the exposition"
